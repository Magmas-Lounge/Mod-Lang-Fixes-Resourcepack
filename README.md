# Mod Lang Fixes Resourcepack

A simple resourcepack which fixes missing and/or incorrect lang entries in other mods.

**Supported Mods**
- No Tree Punching (1.12 version is only on CurseForge.)
- Aether Additions (Only on CurseForge.)
- The Aether
- Minecraft (Some Vanilla items.)

(For those who don't know, Lang means a .lang file, which is what defines the names of items shown when hovering over them in your inventory or via WAILA (What Am I Looking At).)
