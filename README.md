# Mod Lang Fixes Resourcepack

**PLEASE NOTE:** I am very well aware that these issues can be fixed via CraftTweaker scripts. However, this is meant for those who want a drop-in way of doing things, and do not want to fiddle around.

A simple resourcepack which fixes missing and/or incorrect lang entries in other mods.

**Supported Mods**
- No Tree Punching (1.12 version is only on CurseForge.)
- Aether Additions (Only on CurseForge.)
- Aether Continuation (Only on CurseForge.)
- The Aether
- Minecraft (Some Vanilla items.)

**(For those wondering, a .lang file is what defines the names of items and blocks shown when hovering over them in your inventory or via WAILA.)**
